    "openai/gpt-oss-20b": "A net mask (also called a subnet mask) is a 32‑bit pattern that defines which part of an IPv4 address is the network prefix and which part is the host identifier.  \nThe mask is written in dotted‑decimal form, e.g. `255.255.255.0`, but internally it is just a sequence of ones followed by zeros.\n\n```\nmask = 255.255.255.0   # 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n```\n\n**Purpose**\n\n* Separates the address into network and host components.  \n* Allows routers to determine whether two hosts are on the same subnet.  \n* Enables variable‑length subnetting (VLSM) by changing the number of leading ones.\n\n**How it works**\n\nTo test if two IPs belong to the same subnet, perform a bitwise AND of each address with the mask and compare the results.\n\n```python\nip1 = 0b11000000_10101000_00000001_00000001  # 192.168.1.1\nip2 = 0b11000000_10101000_00000001_00000010  # 192.168.1.2\nmask = 0b11111111_11111111_11111111_00000000  # 255.255.255.0\n\nsame_subnet = (ip1 & mask) == (ip2 & mask)  # True\n```\n\n**CIDR notation**\n\nA net mask is often expressed as `/prefix_length`, e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`.  \nThe prefix length counts the number of leading ones in the mask.\n\n```\n/24  -> 255.255.255.0\n/26  -> 255.255.255.192\n```\n\n**Calculating a mask**\n\nGiven a prefix length `n`, the mask is:\n\n```\nmask = (1 << 32) - (1 << (32 - n))\n```\n\n```python\ndef prefix_to_mask(n):\n    return (1 << 32) - (1 << (32 - n))  # n = 24 → 0xFFFFFF00\n```\n\n**Key takeaway**\n\nA net mask tells a router which bits of an IP address are significant for routing decisions; the remaining bits identify individual hosts within that network.",
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct": "A net mask is a 32-bit number used in conjunction with an IP address to determine the network and host portions of the IP address. It helps in identifying which part of the IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.\n\nIn simpler terms, a net mask is a tool that helps divide an IP address into two parts: the network part and the host part.\n\nHere’s a small example to illustrate:\n\nConsider an IP address: `192.168.1.10` and a net mask: `255.255.255.0`.\n\n- The net mask `255.255.255.0` in binary is `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`.\n- When you apply this net mask to the IP address, you can determine the network and host parts.\n\nBinary representation of the IP address `192.168.1.10` is:\n```\n11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010\n```\n\nApplying the net mask:\n```\n11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\nAND\n11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010\n-----------------------------------\n11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000\n```\n\nThe result is `192.168.1.0`, which is the network portion of the IP address.\n\nSo, in this case, the network is `192.168.1.0` and the host is `10`.\n\nThis helps in routing and determining which part of the network the device is in.",
    "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct": "In computer networking, a netmask is a 32-bit number used to divide an IP address into two parts: the network ID and the host ID.\n\n**Binary Representation:**\nThink of an IP address as a 32-bit binary number. A netmask is a 32-bit binary number with 1s in the positions corresponding to the network ID and 0s in the positions corresponding to the host ID.\n\n**Example:**\nSuppose we have a netmask `255.255.255.0` (which is `0xffffff00` in binary).\n```binary\n11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000\n```\nIn this example, the first three bytes (24 bits) represent the network ID, and the last byte (8 bits) represents the host ID.\n\n**CIDR Notation:**\nNetmasks can also be represented using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, which is a shorthand way of writing the netmask. For example, the netmask `255.255.255.0` can be written as `/24`, indicating that the first 24 bits are 1s.\n\n**Code Example (in Python):**\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\n# Define an IP address and netmask\nip = \"192.168.1.1\"\nnetmask = \"255.255.255.0\"\n\n# Create an IPv4Network object\nnetwork = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{ip}/{netmask}\", strict=False)\n\n# Print the network ID and host ID\nprint(network.network_address)  # Network ID\nprint(network.hostmask)  # Host ID\n```"
