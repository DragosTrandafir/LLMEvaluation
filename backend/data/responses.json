We'll cover topics like network layers, TCP/IP model, and a simple example of how data is encapsulated and transmitted through these layers.\n\n### Network Layers\n\nComputer networks are designed using a layered architecture, which helps in breaking down complex functionalities into manageable parts. The most common model used is the TCP/IP model, which has four layers:\n\n1. **Application Layer**: Provides network services to end-user applications.\n2. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer between applications.\n3. **Internet Layer**: Handles the delivery of data between different networks.\n4. **Link Layer**: Manages the physical transmission of data.\n\n### TCP/IP Model\n\nLet's briefly discuss each layer:\n\n1. **Application Layer**:\n   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.\n   - This layer is where end-user applications interact with the network.\n\n2. **Transport Layer**:\n   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable data transfer.\n   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides best-effort data transfer with no guarantees.\n\n3. **Internet Layer**:\n   - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Handles packet routing and addressing.\n\n4. **Link Layer**:\n   - **Ethernet**: Manages data transmission over a local network.\n\n### Data Encapsulation\n\nData encapsulation is the process of packaging data at each layer of the network. Here's a simple example using the TCP/IP model:\n\n```python\n# Application Layer: Data to be sent\ndata = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Transport Layer: Adds TCP header\ntcp_header = \"0000000000000000\"  # Simplified TCP header (16 bits)\ntcp_segment = tcp_header + data\n\n# Internet Layer: Adds IP header\nip_header = \"00000000000000000000000000000000\"  # Simplified IP header (32 bits)\nip_packet = ip_header + tcp_segment\n\n# Link Layer: Adds Ethernet header\neth_header = \"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
